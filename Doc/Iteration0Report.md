## Overview

Our project is to build an utility android app. It is similar to the present day [Notion app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=notion.id). We aim to provide tools in assisting document generation and also integrate with google drive storage medium. We also plan to integrate live collaboration, p2p video and voice chat and workspace sharing. The app will be using markdown markup language to dynamically generate ui elements and for easy storage of the user document.

## Related Work

It is simlar to Notion app, and has few unique features. One which is integrating with Gdrive, and p2p video and voice chat. There could be a downgrade in the visual elements due to material design constraint in android.
